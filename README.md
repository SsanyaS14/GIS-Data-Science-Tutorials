# GIS Data-Science Tutorials
This is used for Gamma Iota Sigma Members interested in Data Science. Currently, we are working on the data science tutorials for you to work on. We have uploaded a couple of notebooks for use. If you would like to get a head start, go ahead. However, we recommend you read over the notebook in advance and attend our tutorials where we will have notes and a presentation. This will make your practice problems easier. You may download a ZIP file of this repository, which is what we recommend you do, OR you may use the google colab, by making a coopy from that link.

You can use this colab notebook to follow along the data cleaning tutorial. There are a few ways to handle data cleaning, unfortunately we cover the basics, not all of them. Please use the resources in the notebook to learn more about data cleaning and reach out for more questions. 

Data Cleaning: Data cleansing or data cleaning is the process of detecting and correcting corrupt or inaccurate records from a record set, table, or database and refers to identifying incomplete, incorrect, inaccurate or irrelevant parts of the data and then replacing, modifying, or deleting the dirty or coarse data
