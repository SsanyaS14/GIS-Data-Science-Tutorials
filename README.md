# GIS Data-Science Tutorials
This is used for Gamma Iota Sigma Members interested in Data Science. Currently, we are working on the data science tutorials for you to work on. We have uploaded a couple of notebooks for use. If you would like to get a head start, go ahead. However, we recommend you read over the notebook in advance and attend our tutorials where we will have notes and a presentation. This will make your practice problems easier. You may download a ZIP file of this repository, which is what we recommend you do, OR you may use the google colab, by making a coopy from that link.

**Notes:** https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_M4zYGLib9Vqi8NQahsuJZbsERckBp_hVU2LjtuL718/edit?usp=sharing

You can use this colab notebook to follow along the data cleaning tutorial. There are a few ways to handle data cleaning, unfortunately we cover the basics, not all of them. Please use the resources in the notebook to learn more about data cleaning and reach out for more questions. 

Data Cleaning is the process of identifying missing, incorrect, duplicate, or corrupt data. Data Scientist clean data for a more accurate, easier to work with dataframe before implementing data exploration, machine learning models, etc. 

## Data Visualization and Data Exploration

Data Exploration is the process of visualizing and analyzing data for more information. This allows data scientists to see which features directly impact the target variable and give more intuition of what the data is saying.
